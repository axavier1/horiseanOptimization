# Horiseon Refactor

## DESCRIPTION
Given the base code I was then asked to refactor the code so that it would be optimized for search engines. 
This will allow it to be more accessible to new users and potential customers in the future

To do this I viewed the source code and found the semantic HTML elements and altered them also well as the images to fit a more accesible and user friendly format.
